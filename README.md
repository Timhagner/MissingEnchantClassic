A lightweight addon that simply shows whether an enchantable item is or isn’t enchanted.
That’s the entire purpose of the addon—nothing more.

In WoW Classic, it isn’t possible to retrieve details about the specific enchant itself; I can only determine if an item is enchanted at all by checking the enchant ID in the item string.
